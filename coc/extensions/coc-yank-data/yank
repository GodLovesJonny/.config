	This paper presents an Inner-cross-modal Attentional Multi-granular Network (IMG-Net for description-based person re-identification. The idea is reasonable and experiments have shown the improvement. Some major issued need to be addressed in the revision:
53656cd84a440d7f4dcae96f6ab30a8f|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/IMGNet_reviews.txt|16|1|V|text
	Because of the modality heterogeneity, it is a tough work to measure the cross-modal similarity between images and text descriptions. To capture the meaningful information from the within-part and semantic information among body parts, the IMG-Net was proposed in this paper. The test results show that the proposed outperforms other previous methods significantly. There are still some problems or doubts in this paper, and the suggestions are given as follows:

	This paper proposes a text-based person re-identification that utilizes global and local features of image and text for multi-granular matching. To do so, the paper introduces two modules: 1) inner-model self-attention module, using a spatial-wise and a channel-wise attention to refine deep feature map, and 2) cross-model hard-region attention module to obtain multi-granular visual representation and phrase representation. Furthermore, the paper employs Group Normalization to replace the Batch Normalization. Ablation studies are conducted to assess the impact of the different modules. Finally, a comparison with the recent state-of-the-arts shows small growth.

	The strengths of the proposed method:
	1) This paper is easy to read, with a clear and detailed structure.
	2) Ablation analysis is abundant and adequate.
	3) The measure of matching visual and textual information via three different cross-modal combinations including global2sentence, local2sentence and global2phrase seems make sense.

	    安全问题的根源
	        优点：分工明确，工作效率高。
	        缺点：从业人员对系统没有整体的认识，对安全认识较为片面。
	        最大威胁是人，人都会犯错，安全问题不能100%绝对根除。
	   安全目标
	        先于攻击者发现和防止漏洞出现
	        攻击型：以攻击者的思维发现漏洞、攻击系统。
	        防护型:投入巨大，会有遗漏，不够全面，收效不高。
	    渗透测试
	        尝试破解系统防御机制，发现系统弱点
	        从攻击者的角度思考，测量安全防护的有效性
	        证明问题存在，而不是破坏
	        道德约束、法律
	        不局限于一台机器出现的问题，而着眼漏洞对整个系统的影响与危害
	    渗透测试标准
	        PETS (http://www.pentest-standard.org)
	        前期交互（客户沟通，确定渗透测试范围，对应用系统渗透任务划分，包括支撑整个系统的各种软件组件）
	        情报收集（收集目标系统信息，被动收集与主动探测）
	        威胁建模（根据收集到的信息，确定最有效，最有可能成功的攻击途径）
	        漏洞分析（通过系统软件版本分析，系统应用漏洞分析写出漏洞利用代码）
	        渗透攻击阶段（并不像想象中那么顺利，目标系统有防护系统）
	        后渗透测试阶段（以一台被渗透机器为跳板，进一步渗透整个系统）
	        渗透测试报告（向客户和其他同事证明系统可以被控制，描述发现、利用过程，以及如何解决）
	    渗透测试项目
	        测试范围（整个应用系统）
	        客户授权（允许攻击还是只是渗透都取决于客户的授权）
	        渗透测试方法
	        是否允许社会工程学攻击
	        是否允许DOS攻击
	    渗透测试误区
	        扫描器就是一切（不能忽略业务逻辑的漏洞。自动化技术扫描工具有他的适用范围，对业务逻辑的漏洞也是无能为力。扫描器是辅助工具）
	    KALI
	        字面意思“黑色”，音译“咖利”，印度神话中最为黑暗和暴虐的黑色地母。
	        Kali Linux中的Kali用意估计取自“黑色”的意思。
	    Kali Linux
	        基于Debian的发行版本，在其基础上添加了许多信息安全工具，用于渗透测试和安全审计
	        所有Linux发行版本都遵循的FHS标准目录结构（BT pentest目录中工具分类困难，工具难以更新）
	        定制内核（主要解决无线渗透测试出现各种错误的问题）
	        支持ARM、手机平台（NetHunter）
	        Open Source Free-Offensive Security
	    Kali Linux策略
	
	    Root用户策略（不同于普通Linux系统小心翼翼的使用方式）
	    网络服务策略（默认关闭所有网络服务，自启动脚本默认关闭）
	    更新升级策略（Debian + KALI官方）
	
	实践是最好的老师，Kali很强大，但不是全部。这只是关于渗透测试的起点。

	There are numerous [Vim resources available online][3]. We have covered some Vim tricks on It’s FOSS as well. Apart from online resources, plenty of books have been dedicated to this editor as well. Today, we will look at one of such book that is designed to make Vim easy for most users to understand. The book we will be discussing is [A Byte of Vim][4] by [Swaroop C H][5].

	The author [Swaroop C H][6] has worked in computing for over a decade. He previously worked at Yahoo and Adobe. Out of college, he made money by selling Linux CDs. He started a number of businesses, including an iPod charger named ion. He is currently an engineering manager for the AI team at [Helpshift][7].

	The book also covers extending the functionality of Vim through scripting and installing plugins. There are two ways to using scripts in Vim, use Vim’s built-in scripting language or using a programming language like Python or Perl to access Vim’s internals. There are five types of Vim plugins that can be written or downloaded: vimrc, global plugin, filetype plugin, syntax highlighting plugin, and compiler plugin.

	When I first stared into the angry maw that is Vim, I did not have a clue what to do. I wish that I had known about A Byte of Vim then. This book is a good resource for anyone learning about Linux, especially if you are getting into the command line.

	When I was a total newbie to programming, I teamed up with my friend Dan to make my very first open source pull request (PR), which would also make it my very first open source contribution.

	The project itself was a pretty good one for a first timer. We were just adding a JavaScript library, something to let people get a digital walkthrough of the website. Just a nice well–scoped project. Self–contained. Bonus, if the thing didn't work, I was almost positive it wouldn't burn down the whole site.

	Yet, I was crazy nervous about this pull request. Dan and I read the docs for the library, plugged away at our code. I still remember when we were finally done, we just looked at each other like, "That's it?" We made our PR, it was reviewed, got merged, and I guess I was surprised by how, I don't know, how mechanical it all was.

	It wasn't some big mystery or magical thing that only they could do. I realized, I really could contribute, too.

Hopefully, you'll see some of yourself in their journey, too.

	There are many barriers to entry as we see them, but we like to call them "no good reasons." There are three no good reasons that keep women specifically out of technology. They are: stereotypes, they're the accessibility, and the environment.

	Technology as an industry has probably the greatest potential to make the most change in the world today. You really want to have people from all backgrounds, from all perspectives contributing to the tools and services and things that are going to shape the world. I think it's really important that people from all backgrounds are creating software and contributing to open source projects.

	In–person instruction has been historically incredibly expensive and inaccessible for people. Again, I think from 2014 to today, that has improved. I think groups other than Girl Develop It like Outreachy, like CodeNewbie, are doing that by providing a safety net or a space to ask questions and get more comfortable.

	Speaking of newbies, back to that contributor we were tracking. When you're not from a mainstream background, that first commit can carry a lot of weight. It can feel like you have to prove yourself. Once we get those barriers to entry low enough, what do we actually need to think about as we prepare to contribute?

	I ended up standing up a Slackware Linux box out of a recommendation by a friend. It was suitable enough for me to do what I was trying to do that I ended up helping them get it packaged for the mainstream Slackware Linux community. And ended up becoming a maintainer and contributor on that project, not because I sought out to be a contributor to that Slackware Linux community, but it most well suited the other project, the use case that I was actually trying to solve.

	I think that happens a lot for a lot of folks.

	If you need direct experience writing code or writing docs, or even being a system administrator for a back-end database web server, most of these communities are volunteer based. You go out to some project like Debian, Fedora, or whatever, and those communities have docs pages that are set up. Those have to run on a web server somewhere and somebody, even a community member that's not being paid to check if the web server's down or something went wrong, is gaining experience.

	I've worked with folks that were television repairmen and teachers, not in a technical day–to–day job, that were very well represented. They contributed a lot in the community.

	Contributing upstream is kind of like going on stage for the talent show for the first time; you get nervous, and you go out there and your palms get sweaty. You do a thing and then it's like an achievement. You are profoundly changed, you never will be the same.

	Profoundly changed? Maybe. There are in fact four possible responses from a maintainer; silence, that's a fun one, or possibly outright rejection, or outright acceptance. Or the squishy middle ground, a request for change.

	A couple days after her PR, our imaginary contributor finally gets a ping back from the maintainer. Lo and behold, it's a request for change. Being new, she takes that as a miniature disaster. She doesn't know yet how request for change is really an accomplishment. She even gets a flash of anger at the clipped tone the maintainer is using. It sort of sounds like he doesn't have time for her.

	There's a wall up, and that new contributor has got no idea what's happening on the other side.

	Meet a maintainer. The project he's maintaining isn't his full time job; it's a weekend project and he stays up till the wee hours lots of nights prioritizing issues, and reminding folks to update docs when they make pull requests, and you get the idea. He's got a full plate. Sometimes he even experiences a little maintenance burnout.

	A real life maintainer, Nolan Lawson, wrote a pretty amazing post that got a lot of traction recently about burnout.

	I think part of that blog post was kind of a cry for help, honestly. It was me expressing that I had stumbled into this open source thing. It was really fun at first, and now it wasn't so fun. I wasn't sure what I should do to recover.

	Nolan's got a day job, but like most maintainers he was putting in tons of after hours work on his open source project because the guy honestly cares. Ironically, part of his pain was coming from the fact that he knows the contributors honestly care, too.

	What really burned me out more than anything was actually just the flood of well–meaning folks. You want to help them; you really, really do. All they're doing is asking a question, all they're doing is—they found a legitimate bug in your project that's blocking them, or all they're doing is—they actually bothered to download the code and figure out how it builds and to contribute a bug fix. They just want you to review their code that they've contributed.

	Maintainers like Nolan are constantly reviewing a library of PRs, figuring out how commits will play into things. They're pushing contributors to do the best work possible, to conform to the house constraints, to contribute in ways that are most meaningful to the larger goals of the project.

	Here is my point, chances are those maintainers are not the jerks a new contributor might worry about. They're working their butts off trying to get to everything. They even take the time, lots of maintainers do, to label some things as reserved for first–timers only so newbies have a chance to take a swing.

	At the end of the day though, the scope of all the PRs and commits gets overwhelming. How do we make sure that doesn't happen? How do we create environments for maintainers that make sense?

	One solution is an open source project with a strong community like Fedora. The Fedora project leader Matthew Miller explains what attracts maintainers and contributors to the project.

	A lot of Fedora is not development, it's all the things that go around development. That's actually true with IT in general, CS (computer science) in general. Open source maybe doesn't have enough of it, the sort of support roles around open source.

	What does that support actually look like?

	One of the paid roles we have for example is the Fedora program manager who helps keep the schedule on track, and bugs people about making sure the paperwork is done. Having somebody paid to do it actually helps keep the bureaucracy down because they can put the time in to make it a human thing rather than something that is just a bunch of paper shuffling.

	I think having corporate involvement like that gives stability to some of the roles that you can't guarantee with volunteers.

	It sort of reminds me of those work spaces freelancers use. There's a shared reception area, shared wifi, and shared coffee. The manager's handling it, and you're free to do your own thing.

	One of the things we've looked at is making natural endings to leadership roles, where you say you sign up for something, it's not necessarily a lifetime commitment. You can re–sign up, you're not kicked out after a year. If after six months you want to move on, you can gracefully go on without feeling like you're letting people down. We've tried to work on making sure people have a clear exit.

	Matthew figures that finding ways to support that open source community without being heavy–handed is the key.

	It's almost like a family rather than something like a workplace or something like that. It's meaningful to contribute to because you're working on this not just for yourself, or not just for some paycheck or an end product, but because the people you're working on it with are your friends and it's something that you're working on together to make something that's bigger than this individual effort.

	Whether it's thanks to Fedora or something else, a world where open source contributions are sustainable, now that's a world worth fighting for.

	Meanwhile, back at her desk, that new contributor we were following just finished the changes the maintainer asked for. She doesn't realize it yet, but she's about to have her first pull request accepted.

	It's easy to lose sight of those earlysteps when we talk about long–term issues like burnout. Every day, there are new contributors all over the world joining the party. That's really why we need to build a sustainable humane place where all this open source magic can happen.

	In the end, our contributor and our maintainer work together to nudge things forward. There's one last piece of the story—remember that all that back and forthing depends on development platforms like GitHub and GitLab, places where we can all come together.

	I wanted to dive deep into how those communities make our work possible. I got chatting with Shannon Crabill about it. Shannon's an email developer by day, but by night she's learning front–end development. She's also someone who knows first–hand about the value of community.

	Last year she participated in a month–long celebration of open source called Hacktoberfest, an initiative to get more people to contribute to open source. At the time, Shannon was very much an open source newbie.

	Thinking back to that point in October, I felt like I wasn't finding much to work on and there's probably other beginners or maybe even more beginners who were also not finding things to work on. Maybe if I put something out there that's relatively easy, they'll have some place to try and learn, and get used to Git and GitHub.

	I think the hardest part is getting used to the motions of just how it works and practicing. How do I push repo? How do I share a project? How do I do pull requests and that sort of thing. I got people to contribute, which was surprising, but also really awesome.
	
752f066edafb1c5eda5c91f0fd8207be|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Linux-cn-Translation/LCRH-S02-RTC-Final.md|280|1|V|markdown
	Was that scary at all? I feel like if you're new, you're putting yourself out there despite even having the repo, period. Now you have people actually contributing and you have to talk to them, and review their code, and have opinions. That sounds like that can be a little intimidating.
	
3bada513a0eebd6d08a3be831e541292|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Linux-cn-Translation/LCRH-S02-RTC-Final.md|284|1|V|markdown
	I think the initial reactions were like, "Oh my God, this is so cool", and also, "Holy crap, what have I gotten myself into?" I realized I had merged my own code into my own code, I merged my own pull requests and pushed to the site and everything like that. I had not done anyone else's. I think I hadn't done a pull request, merging it before then, so I had to figure that out. Merge complex in general is something that I still struggle with a little bit.

	It was this whirlwind of feelings, "This is cool. I don't know how to go about this." Everyone was really friendly, and I just tried to stay very friendly and honest, even if it was just, "Hey, I'm overwhelmed. I see everyone's pull request. I won't get to them tonight, but I'll get to them tomorrow." People seemed to respond well to that.

	Yes. One thing that I've always wondered when you are maintaining a project—especially as a newer developer—is does it mean that you have to be the smartest person on the repo? You're essentially grading, you're judging and reviewing other people's code. Have you had a situation where you didn't know as much as the person making a pull request? How did you deal with that?
	
8d3bc352d95ee4bef8d2009261931b11|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Linux-cn-Translation/LCRH-S02-RTC-Final.md|296|1|V|markdown
	That's a really good one. I could see thinking that, "Oh, I need to be the smartest, best developer ever," would maybe be a hindrance. I think I was lucky that I didn't think that when I went into this, so I was able to go into it like, "Let's just go for it, see what happens."

	You don't need to be senior developer, 20 years experience. You just need to have an idea and just know how to use the software, and just be willing to learn if you don't know.

	There were definitely one or two pull requests that added some really cool features to my project that to be honest, if it broke, I don't really know how to fix it. I can look at the code and be like, "Yeah, it's broken." To be able to build that from scratch, I wouldn't know how.

	I think that's the cool thing about it. If it was just me contributing, I might have done some neat stuff but not as cool as what other people are bringing their experiences to the table with to do.

	As a maintainer, what are some lessons that you've learned along the way to make the project more accessible, more friendly, easier to contribute to?

	Sure. The one thing that I think was really helpful, and I wish I had done this initially, is to set up templates wherever possible and documentation, documentation, documentation.

	I definitely added a lot to my README file as I went, and I think just having a README file to start is a really big step. Just even links to, "Hey, check out our guidelines for contributing." I think I made a pull request template, I made issue templates, "Click here to see current issues," so people aren't submitting the same things multiple times.

	Making it as easy as possible, or as user friendly as possible, I think is a big step you can do as a maintainer.

	Absolutely. READMEs, I see them all the time, I hear about how important they are; I feel like it's also there's so much you can do in a README. At the end of the day, it's kind of a blank document that tells people to read it. What do you do in that document? How do you structure it to make it really connect with people who are looking to contribute?

	What I was starting to hear was that Shannon had quickly learned how important the relationships are. She knew straight away that the work was going to shine if people were invested, and even having a good time.

	There's people doing great things with open source projects, I also think it can be fun and a fun project to say, "Hey, I made these cool bats that randomly generate on this page every time you click."

	I also love that there's so many different types of things that people can do. If you're really into the artistic cool stuff, you can do the bat generation feature. If you want to clean up, you can do that, too. If you're like, "I'm going to stick to the documentation, I'm going to spend my time to make this room, this place, a little bit cleaner for all my other contributors," then there's the option to do that, too.

	Yeah. I tried to make it clear that whatever you want to contribute is fine with me. If you catch a spelling error and you want to fix that, great. If you notice a link is broken and you want to fix that, great. If you just want to help comment this code so it's easier to read and understand, that would be really helpful.

	I think it's really awesome that you had such a positive experience with the community, because I've heard lots of stories where that really wasn't the case. People weren't very nice online, and weren't very welcoming and kind, especially to newbies who we tend to ask some more simpler questions than are expected.

	Just the fact that it was a very casual thing. If you want to contribute, you can, cool. If you don't, that's also cool. I definitely had the thought that open source was this big scary thing, you need to have all this experience and know all these complicated languages, or back–end and front–end and everything in between to be able to contribute to.

	It's definitely changed it for the better. Like I said, I had a great experience and I hope everyone that was involved with my project in some way or another had a good experience, too. It's definitely given me the push to want to try things like that more often, even if they don't go anywhere. It seems more obtainable now.

	My Linux story: breaking language barriers with open source

	I was pursuing a post-graduate degree in medicine in 2000 when I managed to fulfill a dream I’d had since high school—to buy my own PC. Before that, my only exposure to computers was through occasional access in libraries or cyber cafés, which charged exorbitant prices for access at that time. So I saved up portions of my grad student stipend and managed to buy a Pentium III 550 Mhz with 128MB RAM, and as came standard in most computers in India at that time, a pirated version of Windows 98.

	There was no Internet access in my hostel room. I had to go to the nearby cyber café, download software there, and then carry around dozens of floppy discs.

	As happy as I was finally owning my own computer, it bothered me that I could not write in my mother tongue, Bangla. I came across resources provided by CDAC, a government agency that provided Indian language tools based on ISCII, an older national standard upon which the Unicode standard of Indic language was based. It was difficult to learn the keyboard layouts.

	### Joining open source

	Soon, I came across a software called [Yudit][2], which offered phonetic typing of Indic language using the standard QWERTY keyboard. It was with Yudit that I first came across terms like open source and free software, GNU, and Linux. Yudit allowed me to translate UI elements into Bengali too, and when I submitted the translations to the developer, he gladly incorporated them into the next version and credited me in the README of the software.

	This was exciting for me, as I was seeing, for the very first time, an application user element in my mother tongue. Moreover, I had been able to contribute to the development of a software despite having almost zero knowledge of coding. I went on to create an ISCII-to-Unicode converter for Yudit, which can also be used for transliteration between various Indian languages. I also bought a Linux magazine that came with a free live CD of Knoppix, and that’s how I got a feel for the Linux desktop.

	Another issue I faced was the lack of availability of Unicode-compliant OpenType Bangla font. The font I used was shareware, and I was supposed to pay a license fee for it. I thought, “Why not try my hand at developing it myself?” In the process, I came in contact with Bangla speakers scattered worldwide who were trying to enable Bangla in the Linux operating system, via `bengalinux.org` (later renamed Ankur group).

	I@s joined their mailing list, and we discussed among ourselves and the authorities the various flaws in the Unicode and OpenType specifications of Bangla, which were then corrected in due course. I contributed by converting legacy Bangla fonts into OpenType Unicode-compliant fonts, translating UI, and so on. That group also came out with the world’s first Live Linux CD with a Bangla user interface.

	Now, I feel more comfortable using Linux to do my daily work than any other operating system. I also feel proud to be associated with a project which allows people to communicate in their own language. It also brought computing power to a population who were for a long time considered to be on the other side of the “digital divide” because they did not speak English. Bangla is actually one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, and this project removed a major barrier to access for a large chunk of the global population.

	Joining in on the open source movement is easy. Take the initiative to do something that is useful to yourself, and then think about how it could be useful to others. The key is to keep it freely available, and it can add untold value to the world.

	In 2003, I had moved to a place where I did not have access to the Internet; I could only connect to the group on Sundays when I came to Kolkata. By that time, Bangla localization of Linux had become a mainstream thing. Some of our volunteers joined Red Hat to work on translation and font development. I also became busy in my medical practice and had little time left for open source development.

	Over the last year, many large companies, including [Microsoft][4], [Facebook][5], and [Intel][6], came out in support of Rust, and many [smaller ones][7] took notice. As the first emcee at [RustFest][8], the largest Rust conference in Europe, in 2016, I didn't meet a single person professionally using Rust who didn't work at Mozilla. Three years later, it seemed like every other person I talked to at RustFest 2019 was using Rust in their day job for another company, whether as a game developer, a backend engineer at a bank, a creator of developer tools, or something else.

	Amazon's [Firecracker][9] is the virtualization technology that powers AWS Lambda and Fargate, and it is written completely in Rust. One of the technology's authors, Andreea Florescu, offers insight into Firecracker and its related technologies in [_**Building the virtualization stack of the future with rust-vmm**_][10].

	Firecracker started life as a fork of Google's [CrosVM][11] but quickly diverged due to the differing needs of the two projects. Despite this, there are many common pieces that are best shared across the project and in any other virtual machine manager (VMM) written in Rust. With that in mind, the [rust-vmm][12] project started as a way for Amazon and Google, as well as Intel and Red Hat, to share common Rust "crates" (i.e., packages) with each other and the rest of the open source community. These include interfaces to KVM (Linux virtualization APIs), Virtio device support, and a kernel loader.

	### Why to choose Rust as your next programming language

	Adopting a new language, especially at a large company with a long-established technology stack, is no easy task. I had the pleasure of writing [_**Why to choose Rust as your next programming language**_][14] about how Microsoft is looking into adopting Rust when so many other interesting programming languages have not been considered.

	Choosing a programming language involves many different criteria—from technical to organizational to even emotional. Some of these criteria are easier to measure than others. For instance, it's easier to understand the costs of technical changes, like adapting build systems and building new tooling, than it is to understand organizational or emotional issues like how productive or happy developers will be using this new language. What's more, the easy-to-measure criteria are often cost-related, while the hard-to-measure criteria are often benefits-oriented. This often leads to costs getting more weight in the decision-making process, even though it's not necessarily true that the costs outweigh the benefits—it's just that they're easier to measure. This makes it unlikely for a company to adopt a new language.

	However, one of Rust's largest benefits is how easy it is to measure its ability to write secure yet performant systems software. Given that 70% of severe vulnerabilities at Microsoft are due to memory-safety issues that Rust is designed to prevent, and that these issues cost the company billions of dollars per year, it's easy to measure and understand the benefits of adopting the language.

	Whether full-scale adoption of Rust at Microsoft will happen remains to be seen, but Rust's future is bright if only for the fact that is has a clear and measurable benefit over existing technologies.

	Rust is really starting to gain traction in industry. Although it still has a long way to go to reach the popularity of languages like C++. I expect more companies to start adopting Rust in 2020. The Rust community must now set its sights on welcoming people and companies into the community while ensuring that the things that have driven the language to this point remain in place.

	My job title is senior software engineer, but that's not what my closest co-workers call me. They call me "Cherrybomb" because of all the things I blow up.

	I started my career at a helpdesk where I wrote loops that wrecked servers in high-end companies. I have taken production applications down for up to eight hours without warning, and I have destroyed endless numbers of clusters in an attempt to make things better—and a couple just because I mistyped something.

	In light of this, it's reasonable to ask why I am still employed—and why am I writing about this. Those are easy to answer: I'm still employed because my infrastructure code updates work better and faster than the code we started with. And am I writing about this because everyone fails regularly; it is so very, very normal. If you're not failing regularly, I don't think you're trying hard enough to learn.

	You'd also think no one would let me train anyone ever; that it's the worst idea ever because (as my team jokes) you should never, ever do the things I do.

	Here's why: Failure is your first step to success. Failure's lesson isn't just "backups are a fantastic idea." No, from failure, you learn to recover faster, troubleshoot quicker, and get amazingly better at your job. When you get amazing at your job, you can train others about what not to do and help them understand how everything works. Because of your experience, they will be a step ahead of you were when you started—and they, too, will most likely fail in new, amazing, epic ways that everyone can learn from.

	The year was 1978 and a battle was raging in the mini-computer industry. Just a year earlier, Digital Equipment Corporation released its 32-bit VAX 11 780 computer. It was much more powerful than the 16-bit machines in the market. Sales of the VAX quickly overtook their slower competition. Archrival, Data General, was desperate for a new machine to compete with the VAX. They needed a 32-bit computer of their own and they needed it fast, but that competition between Data General and DEC wasn't the only battle going on. There was also a turf war brewing inside Data General and the spoils of both wars would be the creation of an incredible machine under incredible circumstances. A 13-inch laptop weighs maybe three pounds. We take for granted our computers’ portability and convenient size, but back in the 70s, most computers were still room-sized mainframes, multi-million dollar machines weighing several tons. Then, when hardware costs plummeted, the race to smaller, faster, cheaper machines began. The mini computer opened the door for engineers and scientists to have a terminal of their own. It was the machine that led us to where we are today.

	Last season on Command Line Heroes, we took a deep dive into an area that is central to software development, the world of programming languages. We looked at their history, the problems they solved, and how they've evolved over time. Languages like JavaScript, Python, and C, Perl, COBOL, and Go. This season, season four for those of you counting, we are diving deep again, this time into the hardware that our software runs on. We're going to tell you seven special stories about the people and teams who dared to change the rules of hardware. That laptop on your desk, that phone in your pocket, command line heroes put their soul into every piece of hardware you've owned and heroes before them. Their passion for building their bold moves to make our hardware a reality has revolutionized the way we program today.

	In our season premiere, the story of an engineering team racing to design, debug, and deliver a next-generation computer. Their work became the subject of the 1981 bestseller and Pulitzer-winning book, The Soul of a New Machine by Tracy Kidder. The book follows many of the guests you'll hear in this episode.

	He splits up the engineering department, moving a team from its Westboro, Massachusetts headquarters to a new office in North Carolina. Their assignment? Develop an advanced 32-bit design that would crush the VAX. T

	hey named their project, Fountainhead. De Castro gave the team almost unlimited support and resources. Fountainhead was going to be his company's savior. The few remaining engineers left behind in Massachusetts, they felt seriously slighted. They knew they could build a VAX killer, probably a better one than what Fountainhead could build, but de Castro wouldn't give them a chance. So the leader of that group, Tom West, decided to take matters into his own hands. A self-taught computer engineer, Tom West ran Data General's Eclipse division. Eclipse was data General's most successful line of 16-bit mini computers. Tom could build machines, he could ship them, and he knew what the market wanted. After setting up Fountainhead, de Castro told the remaining engineers to keep working on improving last year's product line. Tom and the others were unimpressed.

	We were not happy with that at all. Some of us left for other jobs and others of us were depressed and worried about our careers and not feeling very excited. And we predicted that the other group was going to fail.

	Carl Alsing was the manager of the micro programming group at Data General. He was Tom's second in command. They decided to come up with their own project.

	This'll be a whole new design using the latest techniques, build a 32-bit computer that would beat the DECs’ VAXs. So we put together a proposal for that and went to the president, Ed de Castro, and he says, "Nope, no way. No, the North Carolina groups taking care of that. You don't have to worry about it." So we were discouraged and we went back and came up with another proposal called Victor. We looked at ways of making the old last year's product better. And we had in there a little switch, a mode bit in the system, that when you turned it on, it would enable the computer to act like a modern 32-bit mini computer, although slow. And we took that to Ed de Castro and proposed it. And at the end he said, "You have a mode bit in here. I don't want to see any design with a mode bit. North Carolina's taking care of the new designs." So again, we were discouraged and I think this is when Tom West decided that we were going to do something clandestine.

	Tom came up with two stories. One was for de Castro. They would work on an enhancement of the old Eclipse product line, make it a little faster, add a few new buttons, a different color. Tom pitched it as insurance just in case something went wrong in North Carolina. De Castro approved it. And then Tom told another story, a better story to his team.

	So Tom West proposed to a few of us in the team that we build a really good modern machine that's completely compatible with the previous machines and did all the latest high tech stuff that we needed and virtual memory and 32-bits and error correcting codes and all those kinds of things. Multitasking, multiprocessing, lots of memory. "Guys, we're going to build the latest market-killing new machine."

	The code name for this market-killing new machine, was the Eagle. Nowadays, it feels like there's no limit to what you can do with the memory built into our computers, but back then, a big breakthrough happened when 16-bits gave way to 32-bits. All of a sudden, your address space went from 65,000 bytes of information to over 4 billion. And with that increase, software could deal with larger amounts of data. That left computer companies with two basic challenges: transitioning from 16-bits to 32-bits, sure, but they also had to keep their old customers, the ones using the old software, happy. So, they had to create a machine that would keep old software running, a 32-bit computer that could be backward compatible. The VAXs, for all its power, didn't have an elegant solution to that second problem, but Tom was determined that his Eagle would.

	Eagle HQ was located in the basement of Westborough building, 14 AB. Tom assigned Carl to head up micro coding. Carl assigned Chuck Holland to manage the coders, who became known as the Micro Kids. Meanwhile, Ed Rasala would oversee hardware. He assigned Ken Holberger to manage that team, which was appropriately called the Hardy Boys. Tom had an ally in VP of Engineering, Carl Carman. Carman also had a bone to pick with de Castro because de Castro refused to put him in charge of the North Carolina group.

	Carl Carman knew what we were up to and said nothing to his boss. And so he was funding us, but we needed to keep the salaries down, and we needed some really good smart engineers. So we decided to go after college recruits. One advantage of that is that they don't know what you can't do. They think that you can do anything.

	Jim Guyer was two years out of college and working at Data General when he got assigned to the Hardy boys.

	The machine that was being developed down in North Carolina was much more high-end computing, almost mainframe in nature. And well, I mean, that's a pretty big thing to jump into to compete with IBM and the other mainframe companies at the time. We thought we had the edge because we were trying to do something that was not quite as ambitious and we were really, really, really focused on a neat, clean, simple implementation with low cost and fewest components and so forth.

	Low cost, simple design. They realized that they needed to use firmware to control everything. The more functionality they could put under firmware as opposed to hardware, the cheaper and more flexible it could be.

	And they'd be able to make changes as needed. Of course, modern-day computers are all built this way, but in 1978 the approach was brand new.

	The kind of design we were doing was very minimal. We were looking at ways of making things simple and straightforward, uncomplicated. Because we knew that it couldn't grow to be a big, expensive machine. It had to be just a few boards, a few circuits, and that's actually an advantage in making it fast. There's a difference between designing a product that's safe, risk-free, and a product that's going to win. And we were not worried about risk. We were worried about winning. We wanted it to be fast and cheap and we wanted to design it quickly. So, we only had three or four boards in there, a minimum amount of hardware, and we made up for that with firmware.

	The Eagle team faced a lot of tough constraints. The VAX was the highest performance, 32-bit computer on the planet. Eagle had to match it. But on top of that, it had to be compatible with their 16-bit architecture, too. Getting all that done with less money and time than any other team, made Eagle feel like a serious gamble. But Tom West's team was all in.

	There were two systems running 24/7 that we had two shifts of engineers working on them. We all have to be trying to figure out everything. So, we had to learn what everybody else's part did. That was both challenging and extremely educational for me. But we were all engaged with each other to try and go, "What's the next step to figure out this problem? What do we need to look at?" Everybody poring through schematics and other pieces of documentation to figure out, "Look at this signal, look at that computer state, look at the sequence of steps that the microcode is going through. Is it doing the right thing? Oh wait, it's going the wrong direction. Uh oh, why did it do that?"

	This was serious business and that was the work ethic. It was intense in the group. There were sometimes arguments about which way to do something. There might be one way that costs a little bit more money and another way that was cheaper but not as fast or not as effective. And there'd be heated discussions and meetings with some effort to make a consensus. And we made those choices though. And then we worked together.

	We worked day and night, we divided up the hours for the prototype. We only had two prototypes and it was really important that both teams get to work on those prototypes. So, there were people working the night shift and people working the day shift and people getting tired. But there was enough excitement about it that it was rewarding. And so nobody complained too much about the working conditions.

	The working conditions. Some accounts from that time say that to get what he wanted from the team, Tom West practiced something called mushroom management. Feed them \[beep\] and watch them grow. Inside a cramped and hot workspace, the hours were long and the schedules unrealistic. Tom himself has been described as enigmatic, cold, uncaring. One engineer even referred to him as the Prince of Darkness. Was Tom West so intent on winning that he exploited his team? Did he sacrifice the wellbeing of the Micro Kids and the Hardy Boys to get the perfect machine?

	Tom was an interesting guy to work with. He expected a lot of you, and he didn't give you a lot of direction. He expected you to figure out what you needed to do, and pretty much if you weren't able to do that, you weren't on the team.

	Direction came from Carl or Ed, the line managers that Jim and the rest of the team worked with on a daily basis. But these young engineers were also in it to win and they liked the opportunity they were given, to figure it out for themselves.

	I personally won the first honorary Micro Kid allnighter award. I don't know, maybe we were over competent, brash, young upstarts who didn't know any better. We were confident. We thought we were pretty smart and could figure things out, and we fed on each other's, maybe those are egos, in that sense. I was having a lot of fun doing it. I think most of us were having a lot of fun doing it.

	Carl disagrees with the term mushroom management. He said it was just the opposite. They all knew exactly what was going on and what was expected. It was upper management who didn't. At the same time, Tom West was under a tremendous amount of pressure from multiple fronts, and that pressure got passed along to the group.

	Tom was keeping the true nature of the project quiet. So, he didn't speak much to the engineers, and he remained aloof and he told them, of course, that they weren't to discuss the project outside the group or at home. Not even to use the word Eagle. So we also conveyed that this was very urgent, that we had to do this in a year, that the competition was already in the market, and if we were going to hit the peak of the market with this thing, we had to get it done now. And so they were under a lot of pressure and there was an expectation that they would work nights and weekends and there would be no time for going on picnics with their family or anything that wasn't work-related.

	I wanted to find out what it was like working in the trenches of Building 14 AB. So, I sat down with Neal Firth. He was one of the Micro Kids. He joined the team fresh out of school.

	Not necessarily. He was this ghosty figure. We saw him around. He tried not to interfere so that we could lead ourselves and achieve the goals. This was brand new stuff for what they were doing, and he didn't want to influence us by trying to impose things that had to be done for the previous generation of processors.

	It sounds like an intense place where you really want to keep moving and keep getting things done. How did you deal with the fact that there wasn't a ton of time?

	It wasn't a factor to be honest. There was really no issue with there being enough time. We would take the time it took to achieve the result. That's where the spouses had to be very supportive and understanding, because they didn't necessarily say yes immediately. You could equate it to some of the Silicon Valley people at the time or the Jobs, Wozniak type, let's just get in and get this done. We are not quite all live-in-the-same-apartment and code-on-the-floor type people, but it had some of those characteristics.

	Quite frankly it was solving a problem. I've always been a puzzle and problem-solving guy. In fact, most of the team was that way. All of us had that in our background, and we all enjoyed it. So, solving those puzzles, getting those things solved, discovering a way to do something that had never been done before.

	So what was your most memorable moment on the project?

	At the time, it was quite a ways into the project, and we were running the microcode simulator, and it was actually running what was proposed to be the production simulator, and it had been running for about 10, 12 hours. And all of a sudden, the letter E shows up on the console and then we waited a little while and another letter, then another letter, and then we suddenly realized what we were running for test code was the diagnostics that were being designed to run. And so the microcode simulator was simulating the hardware running this microcode, and it was starting to print characters as if it was actually operating. So, it was maybe a hundred thousand times slower than real life, when it actually came out and operated, but that was one of my most memorable moments.

	No. I was aware of what was happening. I knew what was happening. So, no. I do not feel exploited. It was actually my expectations coming out of college, it would have never been that I would be in a project that significant, or have an opportunity to play such a significant role in a project like that.

	I'm wondering how you think about the sacrifice of invention, because if you think about all the great things that we make, usually we have to give up something, right? Something's got to give to make something truly amazing. Did that happen for you? And if so, what was that thing that you had to give up?

	I wouldn't say that there was a thought-driven process on my part for giving up something. I think it was much more that I became a little more attuned to what I was doing and how I did it impacted those around me.

	But I never necessarily saw it as a sacrifice, and the people I was close to, they lived in a world where that's just the way things happen. I hear the horror stories, if you will, about today, where 24/7 you wake up, you plug in your coffee IVs, grab some pizza or dim sum, and you start coding, and eventually you fall asleep in your keyboard. And then you wake up the next morning and repeat the process.

	We certainly were nowhere near that level of sacrifice. I still had a wife, I still had friends, we still got together. It certainly wasn't a nine-to-five job, but it provided me with a lot of personal and technical achievement, and I was able to share that with my wife, and my sister, and my mother and my father, and my father-in-law. So, those people could appreciate that.

	Key to making something truly great. Interesting question. I think it depends on the people involved doing it, because they want to, not because they have expectations of achievement, or wealth or fame. Because those things are very fleeting and almost never satisfied. But if you're going in trying to achieve a goal, and you and a bunch of people work together on it and achieve it, that really is satisfaction when you achieve that.

	Neal Firth was one of the Micro Kids on the Eagle Project. He's currently the president of VIZIM Worldwide, a software company.

	As chronicled in Tracy Kidder's book, Tom West's aloofness and distance was deliberate. It was his attempt to keep a clear head above all the day-to-day chatter so that Eagle's goal could remain intact. Even more than that though, he wanted to protect the team, isolate them from the politics and corporate brinkmanship happening around them. He also protected the Micro Kids and the Hardy Boys from preconceived ideas about what was possible.

	In 1980, the Eagle was complete. A year later than Tom had promised, but done nonetheless, unlike Fountainhead. Just as the senior team had predicted, the Fountainhead group had failed and their project was shelved. Here's Bill Foster, director of software development at the time, on Fountainhead's struggle.

	I think the biggest mistake that was made was it wasn't given any limitations. More or less, it was let's do the world's best computer. Well, when should it be done? Oh, we don't really have a date for that. How much should it cost? Well, we're not sure about either. And I have to fail Ed with this. He didn't put enough boundaries on the programmers and the engineers.

	And if you turn a bunch of programmers and engineers loose, guess what, they're going to make something so complex, design something so big, it will never get done.

	Let's remember for a moment. Back when Tom and his team decided they would build the Eagle in secret, for two years this was happening. And the whole time, the president of the company had no idea what was going on. When the machine now officially called the Eclipse MV/8000 was ready to ship, the head of marketing went to Ed de Castro to green light the marketing campaign. Carl Alsing explains.
	
7f4b025f36b55d3f1406f536d9edec4a|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Translation-Scripts/Linux-cn-Translation/finished/LCRH-S04-MiniCSOM-Final.md|218|1|V|markdown
	
	The head of marketing, he said, "Well, we're ready to do the rollout for the Eagle and we're going to need several thousand dollars. We're going to have a press conference in six different cities around the world. And we're going to do a tour, and we're going to go to many cities, and we're going to shoot a film and show it, and it's going to be a big splash."

	And Ed de Castro said, "I don't understand. Why are you doing that?" This is just another bag on the side of the Eclipse. A skin job. And the marketing manager said, "Nope, this is a whole new machine. This is a 32-bit machine. It's got virtual memory. It's compatible. It's going to beat the VAX. We've got the whole thing here."

	And Ed de Castro was really confused for a bit. He thought we were failing in North Carolina and that was going to be the end of it, and we had saved his bacon. So, yeah, he invited us all up, and we had a little lunch meeting. There were sandwiches and soda and he said, "Well, you guys did a good job, and I'm surprised. And I didn't realize you were doing this, but we are going to roll this out, and I understand there's going to be a film, and some tours, and you guys are going to be part of that, so thank you and eat your sandwiches."

	The Eagle, now christened the MV/8000 appeared on the front cover of Computer World Magazine. All the media hoopla during the rollout turn that team of secretive, basement-dwelling employees into minor celebrities. After all, they had saved Data General.

	But the good times were short-lived. Tom West could no longer shield the group from the company's internal politics. The team was unprepared for the animosity. Others within the corporation envied their accomplishments and were appalled that they got away with the secret project for so long.

	Soon, a new VP of Engineering replaced their ally, Carl Carman. The new guy broke up the Eagle group and shipped Tom off to Data General's Japan office all before a single MV/8000 was sold.

	I thought we built the best 32-bit super-mini computer that money could buy, and I thought that was a great thing for Data General, and I thought it was going to kick Digital around a little bit, and not that we ever took the world away from them. Competition in that time was just way too tough, and it's hard to be a winner in high tech, but I thought that we had done something worthwhile.

	When the Eagle was released, it did save Data General, but after losing market share to DEC for three years, the company never really recovered, and the industry had moved on. Mini computers were no longer the big thing. The microcomputer race had already begun, paving the way to the personal computer revolution.

	Data General went on and did other versions of that, and improvements on it in other models, and it carried them for a while, and so they enjoyed some success. But things change. The market changed and they turned themselves into a software company, and then they ended up being bought out by somebody else. Now, I think they're a file drawer at some company in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.

	A year later, many in the Eagle group had left Data General. Some were burned out. Some were ready to build something different. A few headed out west to Silicon Valley, keen to find that next creative spark. Regardless, there didn't seem to be much point in staying on at a company that didn't recognize all they'd done to save it. That same year in 1981, Tracy Kidder's Soul of a New Machine was published. Now, the world would know how the Eagle got built.

	If you're asking me what the soul of a new machine is, I guess I would say it's the people and the things that they go through, the sacrifices they make, and the effort they make, and the excitement they feel about that, and the satisfactions they're hoping to get. Maybe get, maybe don't, but they strive for that.

	Alphabet spinout Loon uses balloons to create a floating network of cell towers.

	ISP [Telkom Kenya][2] is launching the first commercially available 4G LTE service using balloons that act as a network of cell towers floating in the stratosphere.

	The service will initially cover approximately 19,000 square miles in Kenya, according to Alastair Westgarth, CEO of [Loon][1], a spinout of Alphabet and the underlying technology provider. Roughly 35 or more balloons will comprise the fleet, moving continually, drifting in the stratosphere about 12 miles above the surface of the earth, Westgarth said in an article [on Medium][3]. "We refer to Loon as a floating network of cell towers," Westgarth said.

	In the bigger picture, internet service delivery from the stratosphere is an attractive proposition for [IoT][5]. At altitude, network coverage footprints can be more widespread, and coverage can be shifted as demand changes—a mining area moves, for example. In addition, there's less ground-based infrastructure to build out or deal with; developers can avoid the hassle of private property easements required for laying cables, for example.

	Service outages are conceivably more controllable, too. A provider could launch another device instead of having to trace faults through elaborate, remote, ground infrastructure. Backup balloons could be staged, waiting to be placed into service.

	In testing, Loon achieved a downlink speed of 18.9 Mbps with 19 milliseconds latency and an uplink speed of 4.74Mbps. Westgarth said the service is capable of being used for "voice calls, video calls, YouTube, WhatsApp, email, texting, web browsing" and other applications.

	### Drone-based internet delivery

	One reason the major Japan telco is interested in stratosphere-delivered internet is because the archipelago is prone to natural disasters, such as earthquakes. Floating base stations above Earth can be more easily moved than traditional cell towers, enabling a quicker, more flexible response to natural disasters.

	Another organization that's exploring the atmospheric Internet is Softbank, which calls its 260-foot wide HAWK30 drones a "floating base station in the stratosphere." (See related story: [SoftBank plans drone-delivered IoT and internet by 2023][6])

	Loon's balloons, in fact, been used successfully to deliver internet service following a disaster: Loon provided connectivity after Puerto Rico's Hurricane Maria in 2017, for example.

	实际上，在灾难发生后，卢恩（Loon）的气球已成功用于提供互联网服务：例如，卢恩（Loon）在2017年波多黎各的飓风玛丽亚之后提供了连接。

	Westgarth said Loon's balloons have come a long way since initial development. Launching is now performed by automated devices that can propel the ground-station-linked balloons to 60,000 feet once every half-hour, as opposed to by hand, as was done in earlier days.

	Machine-learning algorithms handle navigation to attempt to provide sustained service to users. That's not always possible, however, because wind (although not as excessive as can be found at ground level) and restricted airspace can affect coverage despite what Westgarth calls a "carefully choreographed and orchestrated balloon dance."

	Plus, the devices are solar powered, which means they only function and provide internet (or reposition themselves, or feed internet to other balloons) during daylight hours. For that and other reasons, Westgarth and Kibati have pointed out that the balloons must augment existing infrastructure and plans—they're not a total solution.

	"To connect all the people and things that are demanding it now and into the future, we need to expand our thinking; we need a new layer to the connectivity ecosystem," Westgarth said.

	Kenya is underserved by traditional internet, which is why this delivery mechanism is appropriate, said Mugo Kibati, Telkom Kenya's CEO, in a [press release][4]. "… the Internet-enabled balloons will be able to offer connectivity to the many Kenyans who live in remote regions that are underserved or totally unserved, and as such remain disadvantaged," Kibati said. Telemedicine and online education are two expected use-cases.

	Jordan Mechner is a pack rat. He's the creator of games like Karateka and The Prince of Persia. He meticulously saved everything along the way. Journals, sketches, and storyboards. All of it. So it came as a bit of a shock to him when he couldn't find something he'd saved, and that something was a pretty big deal.

	Back in 2002, Mechner was working on Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. The programmers wanted

	 to add the classic version of the game to their PlayStation 2 update as an Easter egg. So they asked him for the original source code. But when Mechner looked in his archives, he couldn't find it. He searched everywhere. The source code that he'd written on his old Apple II, the code he was positive he saved, had vanished.

	Fast forward 10 years. Mechner's dad is cleaning house, and buried at the back of a closet is a ratty looking shoebox holding a bunch of dusty old 3.5-inch floppy disks. One is labeled, "Prince of Persia source code. Copyright 1989." And in brackets, in all caps, the word, "Original." The long lost code, found at last. It had sat in that box for a quarter century, before being unearthed like some archeological discovery.

	But this was 2012. How would he be able to get it off those old disks, and would the data still be intact? Was it, in fact, too late to save his work?

	Saving our work. These days it often happens automatically. With programs regularly pushing stuff into the cloud. We don't worry about manually saving things anymore. In fact, a whole new generation doesn't even know what that save icon represents. Side note: it is not a vending machine.

	But for many decades, saving, storing, and transferring our data had to be done using some physical medium. When the personal computing revolution took off, which we heard about in our last episode on the Altair 8800, there was one piece of technology that became synonymous with saving. The floppy disk. It seems so simple now. But floppies changed the course of our history. Because they helped turn microcomputers into personal computers.

	Let's put a pin in Jordan Mechner's floppy disk discovery for a moment. We'll come back to it. First though, I want to learn how the floppy disk was born in the first place, and how it became such a crucial part of the tech world for almost 40 years.

	Our first stop, 1890. Before electronic computers existed, there were electrical mechanical computing devices. The method for getting data in and out of them was through punch cards the size of a dollar bill. When electronic computers came along in the '50s, IBM standardized those punch cards with 80 columns, and 12 rows. A punched hole would form one type of character. No hole meant another.
	
3e6f0ff00dab8f76b95c8eb40b4ea490|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Translation-Scripts/Linux-cn-Translation/finished/LCRH-S04FDCW-Final.md|50|1|V|markdown
	For a long while, those punch cards were the main method for data input. But handling hundreds of cards for bigger, more complex programs, was hugely cumbersome. There had to be a better way to save and transfer information.

	Next up, paper tape. Which came along in the 1950s. To hear how paper tape played a central role in the origin of personal computing, listen to our last episode. Paper tape had the same punched hole method of reading data as punch cards. But because it's all one tape, no one had to worry about getting cards mixed up. It could carry more data, and was much faster to use. But as minicomputers grew in capacity, they needed more and more tape to store programs. Like punch cards, paper tape eventually met its limit.
	
4fee7ac49fdeb9ffb0e6443f087a190b|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Translation-Scripts/Linux-cn-Translation/finished/LCRH-S04FDCW-Final.md|62|1|V|markdown
	Enter magnetic tape. The key ingredient was mylar, a tough, flexible material coated with magnetic oxide to make the tape recordable. Nine tracks could store up to 175 megabytes per tape. That was a big deal in the '50s and '60s. Magnetic tape drives of 10.5-inch reels became standard issue for businesses.

	But the problem with tape is that while it's great for moving large chunks of data from one place to another, it's really hard to search on them to find anything in particular. We would install software on our minicomputers and mainframes using tape, but it really wasn't that good for anything small and portable or if we wanted to do anything interactive with our data.

	That's Steven Vaughan-Nichols, contributing editor at CBS Interactive. Sure, magnetic tape could store a lot more data. But it was too big and slow. It was only practical for the mainframe world, really. Again, there had to be a better way.

	That better way came along in 1956, when IBM launched its very first disk drive—the IBM 350 disk storage unit. It was a component of the 305 RAMAC mainframe computer, a machine that filled an entire room. Here's Dave Bennet, a former IBM disk and storage product engineer.

	There was storage in core memory. In fact, the disk storage device, of which RAMAC was the first, was a storage device that permitted random access to a given record, as opposed to a tape drive.

	While the floppy disk was originally developed for a new need. The reason was that there was an intermediate kind of storage. Originally there was the computer code, and then there was the computer memory, the working memory. But with System 360, there was a new class of memory in between, which they called firmware. In System 360, there was unique technology for the firmware in various forms. It was either a special kind of a punched card, or there was a thing called transformer read-only storage.

	Interesting thing. That disk drive almost didn't see the light of day, because it threatened IBM's punch card business. But the project was eventually approved. Problem was, the drive contained disks made of solid metal. RAMAC literally weighed a ton. It had to be moved with forklifts, and transported by large cargo planes. Not the most convenient storage method. But out of that, came a better solution.

	But the new need was the desire to go from these technologies, to semiconductor technology, in the days when semiconductor technology was volatile. That means that the memory in semiconductors went away when the power was removed. So there had to be a way of recharging. Bringing the program back into that memory when the power was restored, for loading what was called a micro program, or that intermediate memory.

	The need for such a device is what caused the development of the floppy disk drive.

	Noble personally went through all the things that he could think of, including various forms of punched cards. Including use of tape cassettes. I don't know what else he went through. But he hit on the idea of using an inexpensive form of disk drive based on a flexible disk, and a very inexpensive read-only mechanism.

	So in 1967, a small team of engineers, led by David Noble, started developing an inexpensive system for loading those micro programs into mainframe computers. The codename for their project was Minnow.

	The Minnow team wanted to be able to mail their micro program to various locations that needed to load it. So the product for sending that program around had to be durable enough to fly through the mail without having its data damaged. Some kind of casing.

	Now what they actually had to do in order to make it mailable was, they decided to put it in a plastic container that was fairly rigid. They would actually read and write the disk while it was inside of this plastic container, like an envelope. A plastic envelope. When you have a coating on a disk and a rigid head, you're going to have wear. When you have wear, you have wear particles.

	The problem that they had was that as the wear particles built up, it kind of caused an avalanche effect. The particles would act as additional abrasive. Then pretty soon, with the particles being loose in there, you'd wear the recording track out, and it didn't work anymore.

	So a really smart guy that was on that program, a man named Herb Thompson, came up with a plan that was based on a household dusting fabric that 3M sold to housewives for dusting their furniture. He put a sheet of that in there, between the envelope and the disk. That material picked up the wear particles, and they embedded themselves in that fabric, and prevented the avalanche effect, and really saved the day.

	IBM released their 8-inch floppy disk in 1971. The Minnow team had done good, but they had no idea how good. Their breakthrough was about to evolve into a totally game-changing technology.

	Flexible 8-inch mylar disks. One could even call them floppy. It was all housed in a slim but sturdy envelope, with that repurposed, dust-wiping mechanism. Altogether, it was easy to pick up, easy to mail. With a storage capacity of 80 kilobytes, each new floppy disk could hold the same amount of data as 3000 punch cards. A huge leap forward in storage capacity.

	The head of direct access storage products at IBM was a man named Alan Shugart. The Minnow project was his baby. Shugart was quite a character, and entrepreneurial by nature. He wore Hawaiian shirts as his daily uniform, never a jacket and tie. Shortly after the 8-inch floppy was released, Shugart left IBM, joined Memorex in 1969, and then founded his own company in 1973, Shugart Associates. Specializing in computer peripherals.

	Don Massaro followed Shugart from IBM, becoming VP of operations at Shugart Associates. A couple of years into that gig, Massaro received a request from a man named An Wang. He was the head of Wang Laboratories, one of the leading computer companies at the time. Wang had come up with a method for magnetic core memory that computers would use for the next 20 years.

	When Wang reached out to Massaro in 1975, he gave him a challenge. George Sollman, an engineer at Shugart at the time, remembers.

	Dr. Wang said, “I really want to do the small business system and word processor, but the disk drives that are out there, your big 8-inch ones are too big. We want a couple of small storage devices. They'll sit next to the CRT, and we can't have the big 8-inch ones, because the magnetic fields will corrupt the image.” So he thought we could take the 8-inch floppy and condense it down. So we knew we had to come up with something that was low cost and we could execute. We put together a plain old garden variety flip chart that described what it was, and we took it back and met with Dr. Wang, who said, “I like it, but you cannot use a motor in it that uses AC current because you're going to distort the image.”

	So he said, “Why don't you find out who makes the motors for the tape players in, say, the General Motors cars?” So we went back, we implemented some very small motors that would fit in the mini floppy that would drive a belt, that would rotate the diskette.

	George Sollman had to figure out the specs of this new floppy disk, how much smaller it should be and what it should hold.

	Now in historical tech lore, there are a few variations to the story of how that 5.25-inch size came to be. One states that weighing one of the floppy disk to be larger than pocket size to avoid unfortunate bends and breaks. The favorite folk tale takes place in a bar over several drinks with Al Shugart and a eureka moment when he spotted a bar napkin that happened to be 5.25 inches square. Here's Teri Shugart, Al's daughter.

	What we did is, we looked at all of the tape players at that time, and we figured out their average dimensions. When you get all done with it, you end up with a 5.25-inch diskette size. We knew we’d probably have one time at bat. I think it was when Dr. Wang pulled Don and I into his office said, “Let me show you your disk drives in our new word processor.” And they also wanted to give us an order for some significant amount, 10,000 disk drives. So it was like, wow. We were now there.

	But what really changed the game for Shugart and his team, and frankly for all of computing history, came down to one key moment when George Sollman and Don Massaro decided to demonstrate their 5.25 floppy disk at the Homebrew Computer Club.

	There was a Homebrew Computer Club meeting at the Stanford Linear Accelerator meeting room, which turned out to be about a mile from where we lived. So we brought our mini floppy over and demonstrated it and there was a guy named Steve Wozniak in the audience and Steve wanted to talk to me on it and said, “I've got to have some people pay attention to this.”

	And said, “You're the marketing guy. You're supposed to keep the front lobby clean, George.” And I said, “yes, Don. What's your point?” He said, “We have a bum in the front lobby, we should get him out of here.” So I went out and shook this guy's hands. And he had the most intense eyes, and I talked to him a little bit more and he was very interesting to talk with and he said, “I would like to walk out in the lab with you and see what this thing is that Steve talked about.” I didn't know whether it was legit, but he was one of the more interesting people I've met and it was pretty clear he had a high IQ and a huge curiosity and that was Steve Jobs.

	After the demo, George and Don went back to their regular routine, but a few days later in the office, Don called him aside.

	Steve Jobs hated the cassette drives in Apple's early computers. They were always failing and took forever to go back and forth to get information. For the Apple II, he wanted a floppy disk drive and Steve Wozniak wanted to build it, but size was key. The floppy had to be shrunk down to make the computer more compelling to customers. So in a 2-week span over the Christmas holidays in 1977, subsisting mainly on a diet of McDonald's, Woz built the prototype. It was done in time for the new year's Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas.

	Woz loved building that floppy drive, describing it as the finest piece of engineering he ever engaged in. Jobs hired Shugart to manufacture the Apple floppy. The disk II became a major hit for Apple, helping drive sales of the Apple II computer and changing the industry. Here's Steven Vaughan-Nichols.

	If you bought an Apple II, this was an option that very quickly became wildly popular. Really, you can give Steve Jobs the credit for being the person to introduce the floppy drive to the PC world. People are running this operating system called CPM 80 and there are literally dozens of small manufacturers and some big ones like DEC making CPM 80 computers and all of these computers use the 5.25-inch floppy drive. And then when IBM comes along in 1981 with the first IBM PC, it has become clear to everyone that this is no longer a hobbyist market.

	This is a real business market and that this business is going to be driven by the newfangled 5.25-inch floppy drives.

	The floppy disk and the personal computer revolution were symbiotic. One fueled the other and vice versa. They evolved together. Thanks to the floppy, companies could write programs, copy them onto disks and sell them through the mail or in stores. It did for early PCs what app stores would do for smartphones, opening things up for developers. In fact, the floppy made the whole software industry possible, and as those software programs became larger and more complex, floppies changed again. In 1981, Sony introduced the next evolution of the floppy disk shrunk down to 3.5 inches.

	Because floppies were hand-sized and easily shareable, they had a social quality, like an early form of social media. You could meet up with people and trade disks. This was before people had easy access to modems and before the internet was even a thing. People shared floppies full of programs the same way they shared mixed tapes full of Cyndi Lauper tracks. And this way of transferring data even had a name, Sneakernet, because you literally have to use your feet to transport digital information from one machine to another and what people put on those shared disks could be anything, software sure, but so much more, especially with all the new digital creation tools that started to spring up.

	Well, we all know about Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. The creators of the floppy drives, like Shugart, are not household names by any means, but the work they did was absolutely vital. If it wasn't for that, PCs would have been adopted much more slowly. It's impossible for me to see how the PC revolution could have happened the way it did without these early drives. It just made getting data in and out of computers an order of magnitude easier than it would have been otherwise.

	The smaller siblings were encased in hard plastic with a built-in metal shutter to prevent dust from getting in. They were more sturdy and they could store more data. Funny thing, despite their hard case, they were still called floppies and once again it was Apple that made the 3.5s the new standard when they released their new Macintosh computer in 1984.

	No one had ever heard of an interactive zine before, not even Jamie, but she combined animation, art, and sound and an interactive interface and made them fit on a floppy. She made a bunch of copies, packaged them up and took them to a local bookstore.

	I certainly thought it was amazing too, that you could make something that was interactive and nonlinear on a floppy disk. I was making what became a diskzine. It was at the same time as desktop publishing. I think PageMaker was coming out. People were just getting Macintoshs and people were slowly gravitating to digital.

	The bookstores kept selling out. Jaime received letters from around the world and started getting national media attention. Soon she made a business from selling her disks through mail order. Then her career as an interface designer took off. Her story is a testament to the floppy and the power of Sneakernet. There was a time when you could run an entire operating system off a single 160-kilobyte floppy drive, but by the mid '90s you needed multiple floppy disks to run anything. Files got bigger and bigger and it was annoying to do the floppy disk shuffle in and out of your machine.

	In most cases, they did not have a Macintosh to even look at them, and so they didn't know what was on them. So I'd say, well here, take 10, take one home and check it out, and if you like it, then sell them. And they would keep them by the front counter because they didn't fit nicely on a rack and then immediately people bought them. As soon as anyone with a Mac walked in there and saw this thing for 6 bucks, they were like, “Yes, I want that thing.”

	People still have shoe boxes full of them. Floppies have in fact proven to be one of the most resilient pieces of technology out there. You might be surprised to learn they're still used to maintain the legacy machines like the US Intercontinental Ballistic Missile System. Up until recently, that system relied on 8-inch floppy drives for real. Matthew Kirschenbaum is a professor of English and Digital Studies at the University of Maryland.

	So there was a story that was making the rounds about the US Air Force phasing out 8-inch floppy disks from its nuclear command and control systems. And so this was accompanied by pictures of people down in the missile silos plugging floppy diskettes into sort of old style mainframe computers. And I think that surprised a lot of people to see that something like nuclear weaponry was still controlled by 8-inch floppy disks. The government, the military is finally phasing those systems out. And I certainly think that's a good thing, but it's worth remembering, too, that floppies tend to be pretty durable and resilient as storage media goes. They're low areal density, meaning that they're relatively coarse or low-fi as compared to hard drives nowadays. Which actually made them a little bit more resilient, and reliable. They were also, because of the very age, the very obsolescence of those computer systems. They were ironically more protected against some of the kinds of networked threats that we see nowadays in the forms of viruses, and hacking, and that sort of thing. The phrase people used was the “air gap,” and so the floppies were not physically connected to the internet in any way and there's a way to think of that as a pretty desirable security feature. Even though it made people a little bit queasy. It's not completely absurd that they've persisted in use for as long as they have.

	The writing was on the wall when the 1998 iMac was the first personal computer to ship without a floppy drive. When modems got better and the internet was easier to get on, people moved away from floppies to newer storage technology like the CD ROM and from CDs we moved on to DVDs, SD cards, USB flash drives. Turn around, and there's a whole graveyard of obsolete storage technology behind us. And now we have the cloud. Poor old floppies, they didn't stand a chance. But here's the thing, floppies linger. They have staying power. There's still the save icon for starters.

	Sure. When you look at floppies now, they look flimsy and a bit ridiculous, but with the right equipment, disks from decades ago are still readable today. Who knows what treasures can be found when that data is retrieved.

	He had gotten the Amiga and was experimenting with it and began to use it for some of his artwork and the resulting images were stored on floppies that were at the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. A team from Carnegie Mellon University was able to rescue those files, and we now have a dozen additional pieces of artwork by Andy Warhol.

	Speaking of treasures, it's time to find out what happened to Jordan Mechner and his long-lost source code. To recap, Jordan lost the original source code for Prince of Persia. Years later, his dad unearthed a shoe box at the back of a closet with a bunch of dusty, 3.5-inch floppies. One was labeled “source code,” but was the source code really on that disk? Would he be able to recover his Prince of Persia work?

	To find out, we talked to two people Jordan enlisted as his save-the-code crew. The first person Jordan contacted was Jason Scott. Free range archivist at the Internet Archive.

	Via a long running IRC channel, Jason tracked down Tony Diaz and recruited him for the job. Jordan invited this pair of computer archeologists to his home in Hollywood Hills. Tony loaded a bunch of gear into the back of his truck for the long drive from Oceanside to LA.

	In Jordan's living room. Tony set up an impressive array of vintage Apple II computers and 3.5-inch disk drives. Then Jordan brought out the shoe box in a plastic bag like it was the Holy grail. This grail had rubber bands around it to try to keep the cardboard lid from falling off.

	I took a couple of Apple IIe systems that I have sitting out, back them up, filled about half the pickup truck bed full of various stuff, and I got disk drives that are modified for reading difficult floppies and various tools like that. Disk drive controller that does things a little differently and some stuff on more modern computer that helps with the floppies if I have to do it. Yup, load it all up and hit the road.

	I've been at the receiving end of this a lot of times where I just crack open the old box of disks, and it's all got that same kind of musty smell that. I don't know, it's hard to describe, but for those people who've been on a Navy ship, they all have the same smell. You go to an airport, the backside of it, they all smell the same. The floppy disks have their own unique, what's the word—luster—to them, anyway.

	Tony pulled out a couple of the disks to see what condition they were in. He was ready to take off the protective cover if he had to and clean them with Joy dish soap. The disks hadn't been rotated for a long time. So he put his fingers in the center, gave it a wiggle and rotated it once to check for mold. Then he and Jason split off into two teams.

	I was going to do flux readings, which is where you take the magnetic information, pulling every single wavering of magnetic info off of a floppy and that produces a very large and hard-to-decode image of the floppy. The idea was that if anything else went wrong or we were stymied in any single way, that we'd be able to use that in the future.

	Tony understood what the information on these disks were and he was using utilities on a machine to read the disk as if it was back in 1990 and the data was something that made sense to him. We went after the disks that were very obviously standard copies of files. Trying to make sure we weren't touching any one-of-a-kind disks until we knew what we were up against. Some of the things that were on these initial simple disks were things like Death Bounce. A game that he made that never came out along with an Asteroids Clone. They worked, and we were able to make them play on the machine and he was looking at games he hadn't even thought about for decades and they were running fine.

	So far, so good. Now for the disk labeled Prince of Persia. Tony started analyzing it and realized it was a backup of a hard drive that had been split across five floppies. He needed to put the whole thing back together.

	So to restore those images, you have to have a hard drive volume the same size as the one that you wrote it from. Of course, I brought drives, but what are the odds we're going to have the exact same size because you didn't always. That's okay, I'll make a 10 meg partition on my card here, and I will make a copy of these disks, and I will tell it that you have been backed up from a 10-meg drive. We proceed to restore it and after that get a nice hard drive full of a source code files to go through.

	It was going to work or it wasn't, but you'll always want to prepare for the worst. There's this guy I know and his name is Tony and Tony's relationship to Apple is astounding. He knows them inside and out. I would call him an “Apple II whisperer.”

Oh my gosh, there's so many different versions of it we have to figure these out, but all the heads basically turned pretty much concentrated right back towards the monitor and the computer and it was kind of silence more like, okay, here, let's see what's on this one?

	Once he did that, and we started scrolling through the text files that were on that disk, Jordan recognized them immediately as his original source code. So we just kept going through all of the disks even though we knew we had struck gold, just to make sure we weren't missing some other versions. Among the things we found were other work in progresses from Prince of Persia where he had tried different graphics and so on.

	It's another example of the way in which aspects of what we would think of as digital culture, sort of the artwork of today, the creative expression of our own moment. A lot of it is locked away on these dusty obsolescent floppies, but with a little bit of luck and engineering, there are some pretty remarkable stories that have emerged about how we've gotten things back.

	John Romero who worked on Doom and Quake said that he learned a few tricks looking at the source code and a bunch of other people of course were completely confused as to what they're looking at because a code written in the late 1980s is a lot different than today. The fact that he is byte-by-byte moving memory, trying to clear space so that a Sprite looks like it's supposed to. That's a whole other world.

	The save icon is as close as some of us ever get to floppies these days, but when you see it, I hope you'll remember that it's part of this amazing history we should never take for granted. A history of sharing and rescuing the things we create. A history of saving.

	Well, my name is Mary Allen Wilkes. I was a computer programmer for approximately 12 or 13 years between 1959 and 1972.

	Thanks for joining us Clive. In this episode, let's talk about something a large number of us, not just tech workers, are very familiar with by now, because most of us have had to do it since March of 2020. Remote work. Now, you might think that remote work in our industry is a relatively recent phenomenon. As technology has improved, the easier it's gotten to work from home. Think again, let's listen to this developer's story.

	Mary Allen is 82 years old. When she was a teenager, she fell in love with law and wanted to be a lawyer, but back in the fifties that wasn't a wise career choice for a woman. Mentors discouraged her and told her it would be too much of an uphill climb. By chance, one of her teachers pictured another route for her.

	I had been told when I was in the eighth grade by a geography teacher in class one day, apparently I was giving him some kind of argument about something, and he just stopped and he looked at me and he said, "Mary Allen, when you grow up, you ought to be a computer programmer." Well, I had no idea what he was talking about. Years later, I wondered how he knew what he was talking about. He taught geography and French, nobody taught computer programming. But I never forgot what he said. And I think one of the reasons that stuck with me for so many years was that it was something positive that an adult told me I could do when I grew up.

	When Mary Allen finished college and started applying for jobs, the only place that had a job for a computer programmer was at MIT. Nobody had any training in computer programming. Her main qualification was two logic courses she'd taken in college, but that was more than her MIT colleagues had.

	The Link had a display screen. We called it “the scope” because it was really just a laboratory oscilloscope. It had four boxes that you could set on a tabletop or a desktop, and one box held this oscilloscope, one box held two little magnetic tape units that were pocket-sized. That was basically your permanent storage, your hard drive, if you will. That was where you stored your programs, and you read in your programs. Another box was called a console box. You could use the switches to load some code, some bootstrapping code for example, into the memory of the Link. It also had a keyboard. So, you had the basic interactive setup that you have today, with a keyboard and a screen and some means of permanent storage. And then of course there were all the electronics, which were housed in a big box about the size of a refrigerator.

	In 1961, Mary Allen got assigned to a group to work on the Link computer, a laboratory instrument mini-computer. It was one of the first truly interactive computers, not too dissimilar to a desktop computer today.

	I started off at Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts, a big MIT research facility that is funded by the Department of Defense. We're talking 1959, and I first learned they were using these big behemoth computers, the ones that occupied a whole room. That's what I first learned to program. They were IBM computers. You wrote your programs out line by line in assembly language, and then you handed these sheets of paper to a punch card operator who punched each line of code. Then you took that to the computer room and you gave it to a computer operator.

	In 1964 the Link Group made a tough decision to relocate for MIT to Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, but Mary Allen didn't want to go.

	I said to him, "I want to write the operating system." I was probably the only person who could write the operating system at that point. So, Wesley just said, "Well, no problem. We'll send you a Link. You can have it at home." And that's how it came about. A couple of guys from our laboratory arrived one day in a small moving van and wheeled the various four boxes, the four modules and the refrigerator size thing that held the electronics and the memories and so forth. They wheeled those into my parents' living room in Baltimore. They might've had to create 20-amp circuits for it, but otherwise, you just plugged it into the wall socket.

	Wesley Clark, the lead of the Link Group thought it was a great idea.

	I didn't want to move to St. Louis right away. I wasn't sure I wanted to move there at all. What I wanted to do was write a proper operating system for the Link, because up to that time, all we had was pretty basic little assembly programs that I had written in 1962 and ‘63. And I said, "I could do that. I could write it at home."

	And what did her parents think of this large new intrusion in their home?

	My father was an Episcopal clergyman and he would tell everybody he saw, "I bet you don't have a computer in your living room." It was quite a novelty to say the least. Quite a novelty.

	Mary Allen's parents were gone all day, so she was able to concentrate. She wrote the operating system right on the Link, no need for punch cards, so she could debug much faster. She communicated with her team by phone or good old-fashioned snail mail, and would take the odd trip to St. Louis if necessary. In just under a year, she completed the OS and wrote the programming manual.

	I've been working at home now for several years, since I quit my last day job in 2001. So, I'm a work-at-home person. And in fact, when I left that day job, I said to myself, I'm going to keep working, but I do not want to go to an office, and I do not want to sit at a desk. But by that time, of course we had laptops, so I was able to sit in an easy chair.

	I never felt isolated, and I never felt frustrated. I felt challenged. I think programming is basically a job for introverts, people who work well in isolation, people who work well independently, who don't need a lot of support or interaction with others.

	So Clive, Mary Allen has such a great story and you got to interview her for Coders. She was not just a computer programming pioneer, but a remote work pioneer as well, wasn't she?
	
6aa3d1752d81be37426434e6b97f2c14|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Translation-Scripts/Linux-cn-Translation/finished/LCRH-S05WCW-Final.md|159|1|V|markdown
	Over the years, Mary Allen has worked in other jobs that required her to work at an office. Her preference though, is working from home.

	Well, it's very popular, and that's because coders love working from home. The vast majority of coders, if they were given the choice, they would say, yes, I would work from home all the time. And the reason why is because it just gives them a quiet and a focus and a lack of interruptions from people tapping them on the shoulder in the cubicle. If you were to say to them, "Hey guys, everyone, where would you prefer to work?" They would all prefer to work from home.

	Programming is that ideal kind of work to do remotely. Even my own experience with self-isolation has made me realize that I've been doing exactly that for a number of years. So when you talk to coders, how many of them prefer this work method? How popular has it become?

	Yeah. I mean, as far as I can tell, she is the first person to have a personal computer at home that she's doing her work on. There's this amazing photo online of her and she's sitting there at the foot of her parents stairs. It was downstairs from the top floor, it’s where they have all these components where she's sitting there, a little table, and working. And it's a glimpse of the future, right? I mean, what she was doing then would take 30, 40 years to be realized en mass, that she was completely ahead of her time.

	One tech company that is a big advocate for remote work is Basecamp. They've been around for 20 years and they've been remote from the start, even before it became popular. Their staff work from home around the world. Let's listen to David Heinemeier Hansson. He co-founded Basecamp with Jason Fried. He's also the creator of Ruby on Rails.
	
36dc5bd36e18e7cee4bf7c236230aaac|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Translation-Scripts/Linux-cn-Translation/finished/LCRH-S05WCW-Final.md|159|1|V|markdown
	Actually, for the first six months after I started working with Jason, we just emailed and IMed. We didn't even talk on the phone. So it took six months, I think, before we had our first phone call, and it took over a year until we met each other in person. So for a very long time, this was not conventional wisdom. We got access to this huge talent pool of people who realized that they don't want to live in San Francisco. They didn't want to live in New York. They didn't want to live in Seattle. They didn't want to live in any of these big tech hubs, yet they're really proficient, qualified people. So the fact that Basecamp allowed them to do this was a huge factor in both our hiring strategy and our retention strategy.

	In 2012, I had a series of conversations with other entrepreneurs where I would ask them about their work practice, and we'd talk about remote, and they would just give me these trite defenses for why remote couldn't work. "Oh, you can't do collaboration. The magic only happens around the white board." And I thought like, what, people still think like this? How is that possible? The whiteboard is basically nonexistent at Basecamp. The number one tool we have is writing. It's asynchronous, by yourself writing and you post it, and you let some time pass by. Good collaboration happens when creative people get time and space to do deep thinking and they compile that deep thinking into deep writing. The deep writing consists not of one chat line at the time, but fully composed sentences, that form paragraphs, that form complete arguments.
	
4c563a6d46dda16d1c8b84cc92db5e5d|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Translation-Scripts/Linux-cn-Translation/finished/LCRH-S05WCW-Final.md|159|1|V|markdown
	Then you consider those arguments with the advantage and calm of time. 90% is considered writing, then 5% chat, and then maybe 5%, I don't know, Zoom or Tubal or some other video connection—share-my-screen kind of collaboration.

	So Clive, David is making some super interesting points here. Some I never would've thought of. Are there other ways of working that coders were using that make remote work as success?
	
a555ae670e23ef4d4fcc3b6a2d51388d|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Translation-Scripts/Linux-cn-Translation/finished/LCRH-S05WCW-Final.md|159|1|V|markdown
	Yeah, absolutely. They arrange times when they know that they're going to be in contact and maybe in face-to-face contact. So there were definitely companies I spoke to that said, "Okay, we know our developers do their best work when they're not here, but we want them to be here some of the time, we want to have some face-to-face meetings." They still believe in that. And so they would have these schedules that were like, okay, on Tuesday and Thursday, from 1 - 5 PM, we need everyone to be in the office just so we can have some time to talk. The rest of the time, go wherever you want. You can work in the office if you want to, you can work wherever you want. It could be at a Starbucks, it could be at home. So this sort of interesting latticing of new arrangements is one thing that works really well.
	
86eef303dd5bddcf366fc202c8ceac7f|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Translation-Scripts/Linux-cn-Translation/finished/LCRH-S05WCW-Final.md|159|1|V|markdown
	Another thing that I think works really well is figuring out what's the sort of mode of chat or communication that everyone likes the most. And in David's case, he likes, and his team likes, long-form email conversations. I've definitely talked to people that like that, but other ones, they actually really like Slack, or they really like good old fashioned IRC, right? Like green text on a black background. But they worked out what their co-presence was, because there's this phenomenon that psychologists who talk about online communication describe as ambient awareness, which is the ability to know what other people are sort of thinking about and doing when you're not physically there with them. There's a lot of technologies that allow us to do that. And the best remote teams think carefully about what their ambient awareness method is, and they lock in on it and they use it.

	One thing that I found to be really useful in my own remote working experience is to co-work via a Hangout session or a Zoom session, just letting the stream run and just having that connection open. It's been a really great way of feeling less isolated, kind of having company with the expectation that each person is still doing their own thing, but it gives that opportunity to tap someone on the shoulder, because I can just say, "Hey, I'm stuck on this one feature. Do you mind for the next 5, 10 minutes, can you pair with me and help me get unstuck?" So it's been a really useful way of having some type of social interaction and having those opportunities to get help when you need it.

	That makes total sense. I mean, I think a lot of people try to figure out some way to do that with an experienced person or even frankly, even just with a peer because you can get a lot, even if someone's not senior to you, but is just a different brain.
	
5782ca69a712aec52d932ea2fa0b1f26|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Translation-Scripts/Linux-cn-Translation/finished/LCRH-S05WCW-Final.md|159|1|V|markdown
	Yep. Absolutely. I think it's a different type of communication, but I'm not convinced it's a lower quality of communication.
	
fb78c99ea14e1b1242cc627efd3668ee|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Translation-Scripts/Linux-cn-Translation/finished/LCRH-S05WCW-Final.md|159|1|V|markdown
	So now that we've all been forced to work from home, companies are realizing that they can still get work done. Have attitudes changed to the point that remote work will go mainstream?
	
1868465ab4e83fa1444b6e9236854595|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Translation-Scripts/Linux-cn-Translation/finished/LCRH-S05WCW-Final.md|159|1|V|markdown
	No, not at all. It's like what psychologists would call metacognition, thinking about thinking. Really, the task at hand is: what type of thinking am I trying to do today? And is that thinking better served by being physically with someone, or chatting with them online?
	
5c286c91feb19e174b4bdd9f944473e8|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Translation-Scripts/Linux-cn-Translation/finished/LCRH-S05WCW-Final.md|159|1|V|markdown
	That is a really big question that I don't think we have an answer for yet. I think what's going to happen is that a good chunk of the workers out there, including the developers who have never worked or been allowed to work from home a lot, I'm going to say more than 50%, are going to ask to have that be made semi-permanent. They're going to discover that they're way more productive and they'd like to do it more often, and that a certain amount of those meetings were just not necessary and interrupted their flow in their workspace.
	
49c76bdbf25341c75a7505084e172fac|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Translation-Scripts/Linux-cn-Translation/finished/LCRH-S05WCW-Final.md|199|1|V|markdown
	So I've done remote work for a number of years, I've done it just working for myself, and then once I had a team, I had a couple people that were working with me, but my experience with remote work has been a maximum of four people, and they were everywhere. We had someone in LA and Brooklyn and Chicago, but I'm wondering: is remote work only really successful for small teams like that, for smaller companies like Basecamp?
	
bee520d6e3f8306272077ca7ab868b0a|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Translation-Scripts/Linux-cn-Translation/finished/LCRH-S05WCW-Final.md|199|1|V|markdown
	So if remote work is a great way to be productive, it's getting more popular over time, and especially for coders it's such a great way to get work done it can be a lot more convenient, and our type of work is really meant to work from home, why do these big tech companies keep building such large campuses for their workers to work in?

	Steve Jobs literally created Apple's headquarters to maximize the chance that people wouldn’t just work together, but they would have to sort of convene in places to create those creative sparks.
	
48b621ad82bb17e093a76cbc780b968a|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Translation-Scripts/Linux-cn-Translation/finished/LCRH-S05WCW-Final.md|199|1|V|markdown
	Yeah, that's a great question. I have seen it most successfully deployed when development teams were small, at the startup level, where they had five or six people, and in fact, the reason why they were able to get the talent they wanted is that they said, "Okay, you are in Russia. I'm in Toronto. Our other person is in Tennessee, and we're just going to work together." So you see it a lot in a certain type of startup that has a specific skill set they need and they need to get people that they think are the best and they're not going to demand or ask those people to move. Those are small teams.

	Let's hear another argument about working remotely. Dave West is CEO of scrum.org. Fundamental to the work at this company is the first rule of the Agile Manifesto, individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Here's Dave.
	
60e625f4923b5ba12fa6b56d8c83723e|file:///home/godlovesjonny/Jonny/Open-Source/Translation-Scripts/Linux-cn-Translation/finished/LCRH-S05WCW-Final.md|199|1|V|markdown
	I think it's a little easier to manage the communications because you can almost think of this as the communications between a set of nodes, and as the nodes grow, the number of people that need to communicate grows dramatically. So with four or five people it works really well, with like 50, it gets really hard, 150, oh my god. It gets a lot harder for a company that is 10,000 people to figure out how they're going to do that.

	I think that the reality is that if you really want to build a product at vast speed, working together in a really effective way, face-to-face is still probably the best. That doesn't mean it's the only, and it doesn't mean you can't be as effective in other forms of communication, in other forms of distribution, as it were, however, the best and the easiest is face-to-face communication. I, to this day, still believe that the most enjoyable software projects that I've ever worked on and development projects and teams I've ever worked within have been located in the same physical geographic, same office. And that's for so many reasons. It's because of going out and getting a few beers on a Friday night, the ability to really get that extra level of understanding about a human being when something's going wrong that may be challenging their work, like their dog's died or something like that.

	It's partly based on their idea or their concern that creative thinking only happens when people are face-to-face, and have unexpected connections to each other. And that's based in some actual science. I mean, there is a fair amount of research that shows that a certain type of communication and loose collaboration and loose idea generation happens when people in a company encounter each other that maybe didn't really know each other's existence. I mean, it's a classic water cooler effect. 3M, the big paper company that famously invented Post-it Notes, just a multibillion dollar invention, when one person that had invented this kind of sticky substance encountered someone else who was looking for a way to hold pieces of paper in place. And because of that chance running into each other, they created one of the most iconic products of that company.

	You get that sort of extra stuff that's a lot harder to get from a distributed team. But on the other hand, I don't think all the best software engineers live in Silicon Valley. So I'm conflicted, I think the value of a co-located team is huge, but I also think the benefits, particularly around diversity of people in different locations, is also huge. So, there's a balance that you have to make, and it's incredibly hard. What I do know is that if you are going to distribute your team, then you must pay particular attention to facilitating and enabling the environment to actually replicate as near as possible that co-located team. Which means bringing them together frequently. So you do a lot of screen-sharing, and you spend time together, and maybe you shove on a Google Hangout and just leave it running and just share. Those sorts of things become very, very important.

	So Clive, open source projects are built on collaboration and teamwork. So does remote work hinder that? How conducive is remote work to real collaboration?

	Well, the first part of that question about open source is easy to answer, which is that I actually think most of the big successes in open source have been extremely remote because by definition, the magic of an open source project is a developer saying, "Hey, I've got this code base I'm working on. Does anyone have any ideas?" And instead of just asking the 50 people in your company, you ask the millions and millions and millions of people online. Because only 1% of 1% of 1% of 1% are going to actually have a good idea for you. No one in your 50-person organization might care about the weird little library you're building, whereas scaled across the planet, you're going to find nine people that are just unbelievably passionate and interested in helping with that thing. So in one sense, open source is by definition heavily catalyzed by remote work, by remote collaboration.

	I had only been a developer for a year when I had my second. So there's so much you miss when everybody else is in the office and you're not. One of the things was the little side conversations that people have about work in general. My senior developer would, when I'm coding, he would pass by behind me, and then he would see things that I'm doing and he'd be like, "Oh yeah, I like how you did that." Or, "What are you doing?" The act of him just passing by my workspace gave him the opportunity to talk to me about coding and how to do things properly. It just might be your personal confidence to work remotely, because you just miss some of the teaching and the tutoring when you're not working inside the office.

	It's challenged by it too though, because all the sort of stuff that Dave was just talking about is true, which is that with no face-to-face contact, it's really easy for all the social glue that helps an organization work to fall apart. And you see that in open source projects. They can really turn into nightmares of antisocial behavior online because people are bad at reading each other's tone. They'll think they're just being direct and other people read them as being unbelievably curt and insulting. And things that could be cleared up in like 30 seconds with face-to-face social interaction can tear open source communities, and have torn open source communities, apart online.

	Clive, I'm wondering if the experience of working remotely is different for an experienced coder versus an early career coder, because I can imagine for an experienced coder, who's used to working in an office environment and then has to switch to remote work the change probably isn't too bad; it's probably not too challenging. But for an early career coder, I can see them really benefiting from being around mentors, people with more experience, being able to tap people on the shoulder and ask them a question. So, are early career coders losing something by not being physically around other coders?

	I think they are. Yeah. I think that's a very legitimate concern, and I've definitely heard it from older developers who came up through face-to-face collaboration and knew that wow, they could learn an enormous amount and get unblocked with a 30-second conversation, face-to-face with a senior developer. So Jeff Dean is a senior, senior engineering manager at Google. I heard from lots of people who worked alongside him, that he is just this incredibly useful senior resource because people would come to him with a problem, and he could literally just see the vector straight through it, and in like 20 seconds go, "Oh..." He wouldn't give him the answer, but he would tell them here's where I think the issue really lies, and they would get unblocked and they would go back and they would be unbelievably productive.

	And so the junior people would benefit greatly from interactions like that. I wouldn't say you never get them remote, but they're harder to get. Then there's also code reviews. So at a good company, that's well-managed, you're going to have code reviews where your peers, and ideally senior people who have been around the block a bit, are looking at your code and sitting down and talking about it and asking you how and why you did it this way. And that to-and-fro takes a lot of unconscious decisions that you might've made and makes them conscious, and that's incredibly valuable for learning. To be able to understand why you did what you did, to externalize that for someone else, is incredibly valuable.

	You possibly could underwork, but I never heard about that in all my interviews, both with developers and their managers. In fact, the opposite. I tended to hear that managers were worried that people were never turning off, never stepping away from the work. I also heard that from the developers, too, that it was hard; it's always hard to stop thinking about a problem for developers. When you work from home, you'll spend your eight hours of deep immersion and you'll get a lot of stuff done, but because you don't physically go somewhere else, your body can't help trick your mind into turning itself off. Like if you leave the office and you get in the car or the bus or the scooter or you walk home, you physically go from one place to another, and that physical signal helps your brain reset itself.

	One of the problems I've heard of with working remotely is this idea of blending, which is when you start work and then it's 6:00 and you kind of should stop working, but you're at work, you're comfortable, you'll work an extra hour or two, and you end up overworking when you're working remotely. Is that a thing? And then kind of the opposite of that, can you underwork by working remotely?

	There's just lots and lots of science on this. I mean, literally physically going from one room to another helps your brain reset itself. When you don't have the ability to do that, when you work from home, the natural chess-like mental space of a coding problem becomes very hard to tell your brain to stop working on it. And so there's a lot of reasons why people who work from home just keep on going in a way that they know is unhealthy, but they have trouble stopping.

	We have some funny anecdotes of how people at Basecamp have dealt with this over time. We had a data analyst at one time who had two sets of slippers. He had his work slippers that he would get into when he walked into the office and then you would have his home slippers. They were both just a set of slippers. They just provided the separation between work and home. And I think that separation is pretty important. I think for a lot of people who do use their home, being able to segregate one room of the house for that and then when you leave that room, you're no longer at work is also a healthy practice.

	So Clive, are there other tips or tricks to managing a workforce remotely or even being a remote worker?

	Sure, if a company is going to have a serious remote culture, one important thing is for people at the top to also work remotely so that there isn't this sense that remote is this secondary status and that big decisions are being made face-to-face by important people and the remote people are not part of that. An example of that, that I ran into while researching my book, was when I was talking to some of the engineers for Postlight, which is a terrific company here in New York City. They develop apps mostly for the media industries. The head of engineering was remote, and he was working in the woods south of Nashville. When I talked to him, he said, “This is a really important thing, because we have a lot of remote engineers, and they like knowing that I'm heading up the engineering workforce, and I myself am remote." It means that everyone in the company thinks very mindfully about how to make remote work, because the person running the show in that part of it was himself remote.

	It's very easy to lose track of time. You could be sitting there for a few hours and not know how long you've been coding away because you're at home. How I fixed that was I had a Pomodoro timer and I would make sure to take dedicated breaks every hour or so. Then just being able to like separate home from work. I have an office at home, and I don't let my home life come into the office to make sure I separate the two. So when I'm outside, I can be mommy or whoever I am when I'm not at work, but then when I come inside the office, it's go-time and it's a lot easier to get into the flow of working. I would do a quick status update every day. In the morning, I'd let them know this is what I'm working on today and then in the evening, I'd let them know where I was. I don't think there's any such thing as over-communication when you're working remotely. So yeah, just communicate, communicate.

	Most of us had to make a drastic shift in how we work since March of 2020—working from home, whether we did that already or not. And when we work from home, it comes down to our personal work style and making sure that whatever project we're working on, whatever company we're with, whoever we're managing or being managed by, our individual preferences are respected and we're allowed the flexibility to work how we work best. Putting people over process isn't just the first rule of the Agile Manifesto, it's the open source way, and it's the approach that yields the best results. For more research on this episode, go to [redhat.com/commandlineheroes](//www.redhat.com/en/commandlineheroes).

	About five years ago now, I handed in my Google employee badge and walked out of the Sydney Google office to start a new life of self-employment. I figured I should write up this story because I got a lot out of reading [Michael Lynch’s][1]. As you can see, it’s still taken me a couple of years to get around to writing this post, but I finally told myself that if I don’t write it for the fifth anniversary, I never will.

	This post is kind of long, but I hope it has something useful for new developers who are interested in working at a big tech company, or for big company employees who are wondering what it’s like to quit. I’ll talk about my story of getting into, working at and quitting Google, and what I’ve done since. Feel free to ask if you want more detail about something, though I already have a lot of blog posts to write, so I can’t promise anything in-depth straight away.

	Also, at the risk of labouring the obvious: I haven’t worked at Google for five years, so don’t take this story as a literal description of Google today or what all Google employees experience. However, I think a lot of it’s still relevant to tech careers in general.

	I got my first paid programming job in 2005. It was working at the local power company, taking some old Pascal code and making it work on a different OS with a different compiler. It was basically just a summer job for extra money while doing the maths and physics degree I’d started that same year. They were happy to have an undergraduate who could do the job; I was just blown away that these grown ups were not only interested in my programming hobby, but actually going to give me real money for it.

	I kept doing stuff like that until I graduated in 2007. I liked programming work, and Google was a cool company doing cool programming stuff, so I applied for an internship. The Google interview process was famous for being tough, so I spent weeks practising on all the Google interview problems I could find online. I don’t think the process has changed much in 13 years: I submitted a résumé, and I got invited to a few rounds of phone interviews that were mostly algorithmic problems (I remember a dynamic programming one and a divide-and-conquer geometric one). I passed the initial interviews, and got invited to come to Sydney for a day of on-site interviews with Google engineers. I went home and waited for what felt like an eternity for the phone call from Google HR. I got rejected.

	It’s natural to feel bad about our rejections and failures, so we don’t talk about them much. But for the same reason, other people don’t talk about theirs, which only makes things worse. When I _did_ get into Google later, I felt like there must be something a bit wrong with me as a “ex-reject”, but one day I was at a table with a bunch of colleagues and the conversation came up. That’s when I discovered that actually a lot of people around me had been rejected at least once. I wasn’t even the “worst”. One guy joked that he must have only got in because Google HR got tired of rejecting him. I’m talking about some pretty impressive engineers, as well — some were responsible for code I use all the time, and I bet you use, too.

	Companies that do interviews usually interview two or more candidates for each hire. That means there are more rejections around than acceptances, so the average interviewee gets rejected more often than not. Yet we keep forgetting that. Four developers go into an interview; one gets hired, the other three rant on social media about how the interview was totally flawed because they personally got rejected. Sure, interviews are far from perfect, but we need to stop taking them so personally.

	Rejection and failure aren’t so bad as long as you can figure out what went wrong and how you could improve yourself. The Google interviews were heavily algorithm-oriented, and I fumbled through a lot of them but definitely didn’t come out shining.

	After the Google rejection, I got two things and took a kind of sabbatical year. The first thing was an Australian Business Number (ABN) that I used to do maths and science tuition, as well as tech job contracts. The other thing I got was a library card at the university science and tech library. I wasn’t planning to interview at Google again, but the interview experience told me there was a lot I didn’t know. I’d give tutorials in the library and read books in between. By the way, a few people thought I was weird for doing all that accounting and stuff for my tuition business, when most tutors just did it cash-in-hand. But I learned a lot that’s helped me later in life, so I don’t regret a thing.

	As I said, I hadn’t planned to interview for Google again, but let me fast forward to how it happened. I’d been studying Japanese since high school, so in 2012 I decided to try living in Tokyo. That mostly worked out, except I made one pretty big mistake: I didn’t have any paper qualifications in Japanese, so it was really hard to get job interviews. Eventually, a friend of mine who had been accepted at Google suggested I give it another try. Like all Google offices, the official business language at Google Tokyo is English, so they didn’t require me to have Japanese qualifications.

	My friend gave me a recommendation to Google HR. That definitely helps, but don’t get too excited if you get a recommendation, yourself. It ensures your résumé gets noticed (not trivial) and cuts one of the phone interviews, but you still have to pass the remaining phone and on-site interviews.

	This time I practised using problems from [Project Euler][2] and [Google CodeJam][3]. I had to do some live programming in a Google Doc during the phone interview, which was a bit awkward, but otherwise the phone interviews went okay. Then I got invited to the Mori Tower office in Roppongi for a day of onsite interviews.

	My first interview went terribly. I got brain freeze. I knew I could solve the problem, but I couldn’t think straight until the interviewer walked out of the room. Instantly I relaxed and recognised it as a ternary search problem. That was pretty frustrating, but I decided to just keep going and see how the rest of the interviews went.
